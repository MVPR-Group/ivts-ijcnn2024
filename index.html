    <h1>Special Session Objectives and Topics</h1>
    <p class="content">
        The research and development of intelligent vehicles and transportation systems are rapidly growing worldwide. Intelligent transportation systems are making transformative changes in all aspects of surface transportation based on vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V), vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) connectivity, and automated driving (AV). With the support of advanced equipment, a host of intelligent devices in cars have made various functions in practice, such as airbag control, unwelcome intrusion detection, collision warning and avoidance, power management and navigation, driver alertness monitoring, etc. Among those functions, the neural network plays a critical role in building all types and levels of intelligence in vehicle and transportation systems. The objective of this special session is to provide a forum for researchers and practitioners to present advanced research in neural network models with a focus on innovative applications for intelligent vehicle and transportation systems.
    </p>
    <p class="content">
        This session seeks contributions on the latest developments and emerging research in all aspects of intelligent vehicle and transportation systems. Specific topics include, but are not limited to:
