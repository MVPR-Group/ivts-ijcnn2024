    <h1>Special session objectives and topics</h1>
    <p class="content">
        The research and development of intelligent vehicles and transportation systems is rapidly growing worldwide. Intelligent transportation systems are making
transformative changes in all aspects of surface transportation based on technologies developed in automated driving, vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicleto-
infrastructure (V2I) connectivity. With decreasing costs of sensors and computer chips, and increasing computing power and data storage capacity, it has
become practical to build a host of intelligent devices in cars that can be used in airbag control, unwelcome intrusion detection, collision detection, warning
and avoidance, power management and navigation, and driver alertness monitoring, etc. Computational intelligence plays a vital role in building all types and
levels of intelligence in vehicle and transportation systems.
    </p>
    <p class="content">
        The objective of this special session is to provide a forum for researchers and practitioners to present advanced research in computational intelligence with a
